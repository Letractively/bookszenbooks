So this is it - the day of the presentation. Guys, we're meeting today at around 11:00, so be ready to go over the presentation slides I posted earlier. Also, if you have any diagrams or anything to post, please post it ASAP!

The main good news so far is that the frontend of the system is just about finished. I've been working on getting a schnazzy, clean UI up, and I think what I've come up with is pretty good to start. Obviously, it could use some polishing, but it works for what we need.

**_Things that still need to be done by 12/18:_**
  * Sequence diagrams
  * Use case diagrams
  * Verify use cases
  * Software Specs Sheet
  * As much coding as possible:
    * Update profile
    * Send validation email when registering
    * Add/remove from card
    * Checkout
    * All manager functions (doh!)

Lots of updates to the diagrams and use cases over the last two days, check the update revision log if you're curious. Main changes:

  * ShoppingCartEntry entity added to the database model.
  * Sequence diagrams now include the DBDriver object as an interface to the database.
  * Sequence diagrams also contain the business classes they reference (eg. Book, User, Lexicon, etc).
  * Filled out the Administrative use cases for Lexicons and Templates.

Don't forget, we're meeting today at 12:30!

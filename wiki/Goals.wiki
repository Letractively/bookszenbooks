#summary The primary goals of the Books Zen Books project.

= What is Books Zen Books? =

Books Zen Books (BZB) is a web-based application written in Java (JSP) as a collaborative project for our Object Oriented Software college course. It combines Object Oriented design methods and a SQL backend to show what we have learned during our college career.

= Who Would Use Books Zen Books? =

Our goal is to create an intuitive web interface to allow college students to trade books with one another in a local setting. Ideally, the software would be distributed to college/university campuses around the world. An administrator would set the software up, and students would be able to register for an account using their college email address. Students could then post books to sell, or purchase books posted by other students.

Since the students belong to the same college campus, they could arrange to meet each other to exchange their books, thus minimizing the need to ship books and pay a shipping fee. And since the students themselves set the prices, it is likely that both the buyer and seller will benefit (compared to buying directly from a bookstore) money-wise.
